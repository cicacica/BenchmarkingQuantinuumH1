# BenchmarkingQuantinuumH1
Suite of python code related to benchmarking the Quantinuum H1 series for MBQC verification

## Getting started

The code here must be run with a Quantinuum account and has been developed using the Nexus interface.

## Single qubit experiments

### Prepare qubit and measure in computational basis

Initialise a circuit and measure in comptational basis. Perform over an increasing number of shots and observe expected outcome ([experiments/20240412_measuring_convergence_state_prep](experiments/20240412_measuring_convergence_state_prep))
